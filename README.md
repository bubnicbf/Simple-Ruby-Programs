# Simple-Ruby-Programs
A dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.

  - Thoroughly object-oriented with inheritance, mixins and metaclasses
  - Dynamic typing and duck typing
  - Everything is an expression (even statements) and everything is executed imperatively (even declarations)
  - Succinct and flexible syntax that minimizes syntactic noise and serves as a foundation for domain-specific languages
  - Dynamic reflection and alteration of objects to facilitate metaprogramming
  - Lexical closures, iterators and generators, with a unique block syntax
  - Literal notation for arrays, hashes, regular expressions and symbols
  - Embedding code in strings (interpolation)
  - Default arguments
  - Four levels of variable scope (global, class, instance, and local) denoted by sigils or the lack thereof
  - Garbage collection
  - First-class continuations
  - Strict boolean coercion rules (everything is true except false and nil)
  - Exception handling
  - Operator overloading
  - Built-in support for rational numbers, complex numbers and arbitrary-precision arithmetic
  - Custom dispatch behavior (through method_missing and const_missing)
  - Native threads and cooperative fibers (fibers are 1.9/YARV feature)
  - Initial support for Unicode and multiple character encodings (no ICU support)
  - Native plug-in API in C
  - Interactive Ruby Shell (a REPL)
  - Centralized package management through RubyGems
  - Implemented on all major platforms
  - Large standard library, including modules for YAML, JSON, XML, CGI, OpenSSL, HTTP, FTP, RSS, curses, zlib, and Tk
